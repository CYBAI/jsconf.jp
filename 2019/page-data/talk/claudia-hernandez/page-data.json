The world is in chaos but the web is stronger than ever. We saw the rise and fall of great frameworks that changed how we built things but we also lost brave fellows along the way to JS fatigue. React v30.0 was just released, ES10 is the new de facto standard for writing modern applications, and Javascript is used to control androids that dream of electric sheep.\n\nRewind to 2019. Is WebAssembly the future of web development? How will the web look like in 10 years? The pace of technology change can be scary at times so… how can we keep up in this fast-paced world? Should we keep betting on JS? Let’s discuss together the future of the web and understand why we should be pretty excited about it!","descriptionJa":"","spokenLanguage":"en","slideLanguage":"","speakerIDs":["claudia-hernandez"],"date":"day2","startsAt":"13:30","endsAt":"14:00","room":"C"}}}}
