It has become the standard. With the ever increasing number of web-apps, we’re seeing more and more data breaches as well. What if we could build our authentication processes in a way the user doesn’t need a password?\n\nIn this talk I will give a quick overview of the past, present and future of authentication. From basic authentication to passwordless biometric authentication using the web authentication API, and everything in between. The audience does not need any specific knowledge as this talk will not go into implementation details, but aims to give a view of what’s to come in terms of authentication.","descriptionJa":"","spokenLanguage":"en","slideLanguage":"","speakerIDs":["sam-bellen"],"date":"day2","startsAt":"13:00","endsAt":"13:30","room":"C"}}}}
