From the connections between people, between cultures, within language, and more. In these days when more data is collected daily than we could ever hope to explore, the variety in connections being gathered is opening up the possibility to visualize these (often complex) networks.\nDuring this talk, Nadieh will take you through the design process of several of her (interactive) data visualization works, from personal projects to client work. The common thread they all share, is that they all reveal connections, but all differently. From a family tree of 3000 people connected to the European Royal houses, to those existing between our Intangible Cultural Heritage created for UNESCO, to connections we have drawn in the night skies and more. Revealing that all types connections are unique and revealing the intricacies that lie within them requires a creative, iterative and custom approach.","descriptionJa":"","spokenLanguage":"en","slideLanguage":"","speakerIDs":["nadieh-bremer"],"date":"day1","startsAt":"14:15","endsAt":"14:45","room":"A"}}}}
