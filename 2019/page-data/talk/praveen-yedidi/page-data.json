By building a model of pages a user is likely to visit, given an arbitrary entry-page, a solution could calculate the likelihood a user will visit a given next page or set of pages and prefetch resources for them while the user is still viewing their current page. This has the possibility of improving page-load performance for subsequent page visits as there's a strong chance a page will already be in the user's cache.","descriptionJa":"","spokenLanguage":"en","slideLanguage":"","speakerIDs":["praveen-yedidi"],"date":"day1","startsAt":"18:15","endsAt":"18:25","room":"A"}}}}
