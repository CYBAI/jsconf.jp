This package became the delivery mechanism for malicious code that traversed through multiple environments to inject its final payload into a mobile application. This exploit existed in the wild for 48 days and was downloaded over 8 million times before it was found. How was it found? What was its purpose and how did it happen in the first place?\n\nThis exploit is one example of a well-planned, sophisticated attack that targeted the most valuable and privileged computers in a company, development and build machines. In this session we will dive into how the attack happened, the three payloads, how they worked, how they were obfuscated, and what their goal ultimately was.\n\nThis is not node/npm specific and any public repository of source code is vulnerable. This is a growing risk that many companies are absorbing without fully understanding and, without better management, will inevitably lead to incredible exploits in the future.","descriptionJa":"","spokenLanguage":"en","slideLanguage":"","speakerIDs":["jarrod-overson"],"date":"day2","startsAt":"14:45","endsAt":"15:15","room":"A"}}}}
